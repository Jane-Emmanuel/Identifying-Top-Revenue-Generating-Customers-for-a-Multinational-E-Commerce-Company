### Data Collection
Sales data was obtained from a central transaction database of the company representing orders placed by customers across multiple countries. Each record included attributes such as:

* `Customer ID`
* `OrderNo`
* `OrderQuantity`
* `CostPrice_usd`
* `SellingPrice_usd`
* `OrderDate`
* `CustomerName`
* `CustomerCity`
* `CustomerState`
* `CustomerCountry`
* `ProductCategory`
* `ProductColor`
* `Model`

### Data Pre-processing
__Task:__ Follow the appropriate steps in reading a CSV file into a pandas Dataframe, 


and  Read the data stored  in the csv file named:  `bikes` From your computer.


The resulting Dataframe should be named : `bikes_df`

```python
# solution
import pandas as pd
bikes_df = pd.read_csv("C:/Users/USER/Downloads/bikes.csv")
bikes_df

```

total_number_of_missing_values_by_column = bikes_df.isna().sum()

total_number_of_missing_values_by_column

```
![Number of missing values](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9998bbff-2b84-4d99-a6fd-10d80766562a)

```python

# visualizing the total number of missing values

revenue_sum_of_entire_company = bikes_df["SalesRevenue"].sum().round(1)

revenue_sum_of_entire_company
```

```python
Percentage_revenue_top_10_customers = (revenue_summary_of_top_ten_customers / revenue_sum_of_entire_company) * 100

### Data Interpretation

The result from the data visualization above shows that all the **Top 10 customers** are all based in **France**

### Key Findings

---

1. **France Dominates among Top-Tier-High-Value-Customers**: 
   All **The Top 10 Customers** are based in **France**, indicating a strong customer base and market penetration in this region.


2. The Company's **Top 10 Customers** Contribute Less Than **1% of Total Revenue of the entire company**.

   
   Despite **France** being the **top revenue generators**, these customers collectively account for a **very small fraction** of the company's overall sales — indicating **broad and diversified revenue streams**.

4. **Revenue is Distributed, Not Concentrated**
   Unlike typical e-commerce businesses that follow the Pareto Principle (80% of revenue from 20% of customers), this company’s revenue is **evenly spread across thousands of customers**, highlighting a mass-market model.


5. **High-Value Customers Are Geographically Clustered**
   The top revenue-generating customers are concentrated in specific cities and departments such as:

   * **Tremblay-en-France**, **Les Ulis**, and **Saint-Denis** in **Seine Saint Denis** and **Essonne**
   * Major urban centers like **Paris**, **Metz**, and **Dunkerque**

6. **Narrow Revenue Spread Among Top Customers**
   The revenue range of the top 10 customers is relatively narrow—from **\$13,144.88** to **\$13,708.12**, suggesting consistent purchasing behavior across the top customer tier.

7. **Top Customers Still Exhibit Stable Purchasing Behavior**
   While their individual contribution is small relative to total revenue, the top customers show **stable, high-value purchasing patterns** — useful for identifying ideal customer personas or retention targets.

8. **Customer Loyalty and Repeat Purchases Likely**
   Given the similar revenue volumes, it’s likely that these customers have regular or subscription-based purchasing behavior.

---

### Conclusions
---

The company's sales data analysis reveals that the company operates a **high-volume, low-concentration revenue model**, where no single customer or small group significantly influences total revenue. 

This suggests a **wide customer base**, possibly driven by individual, one-time, or small-ticket purchases.

Furthermore, the sales data reveals that the company’s **top 10 most valuable customers are concentrated entirely in France**, with a significant cluster in **Île-de-France** and surrounding regions. 


This concentration indicates a **strong local market presence**, but also highlights a **potential risk** if the company's sales efforts are overly dependent on a single region.

While the **top 10 customers** do not represent a **major share of total sales**, understanding their behavior is still useful for profiling ideal, repeat-purchase customers. Moreover, the fact that all top performers are from France indicates a **regional pattern** in customer loyalty or market engagement.


However, the **absence of high-revenue customers** from other regions such as the **United States, Canada, Germany, UK, and Australia** points to a **potential gap in customer acquisition** or expansion strategy.

---


### Recommendation
---

### 1. **Expand High-Value Customer Acquisition Beyond France**

* Launch targeted marketing campaigns in **United States, Canada, Germany, UK, and Australia** to balance regional revenue dependency.
* Use the profile of these French customers to find “look-alike” customers in other countries.

### 2. **Focus on Scaling Average Customer Spend**

* Instead of concentrating only on top customers, create **broad-based incentives** (e.g., product bundles, loyalty points) to **lift the average order value** across all customers.

### 3. **Replicate High-Value Customer Traits Across the Base**

* Analyze what makes the top 10 customers spend more (location, product type, frequency) and **apply that insight to encourage similar behavior** in the general customer base.


### 4. **Strengthen Customer Retention in France**

* Reward top customers in France with loyalty programs, premium services, or early-access deals.
* Consider customer interviews or surveys to understand what keeps them engaged.


### 5. **Run Regional A/B Tests**

* Test localized marketing efforts in other regions using the same product mix that appeals to French customers.

### 6. **Mitigate Regional Risk**

* Relying heavily on France puts the company at risk in the event of regional disruptions (economic, political, or logistical).
* Diversify revenue sources across other major European and American markets.
